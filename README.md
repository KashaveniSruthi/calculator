**Transparent Calculator**

A visually appealing, fully functional, and responsive calculator with a transparent design, created using HTML and CSS.

**Features**

Modern Design: Transparent background with rounded corners and shadows for a sleek and elegant appearance.

Responsive Layout: The calculator is perfectly centered and adjusts to different screen sizes.

Interactive UI: Buttons and inputs styled for a polished user experience.

**Technologies Used**

HTML5: Provides the structure for the calculator.

CSS3: Adds styling, responsive design, and interactivity (e.g., hover and active states).

**Limitations**
This project uses only HTML and CSS. The calculator buttons are static, and the functional aspects (e.g., performing calculations) require JavaScript or another programming language.

Future iterations can integrate JavaScript or other technologies for full interactivity.

*How to Use*
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/KashaveniSruthi/calculator

**Future Plans**

Add JavaScript or other programming languages for arithmetic operations.

Implement advanced features such as keyboard support, scientific functions, and error handling.

Enhance accessibility for better usability with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
